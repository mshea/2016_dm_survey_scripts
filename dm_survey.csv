My current favourite tool for such occasions are Metal Weave Designs' NPC Cards.  They allow me to add a great deal of depth to an NPC and generate great story hooks.  I also regularly use the regular GM screen info for NPC names.  I was also using Scenes of Chance cards to generate general story direction.  These offer a cool Tarot-esque flavour to the game.","As all good DMs do, I let my players define the hook to adventures through their questions and assumptions.  If my players try to power game, I let them, but I add in a consequence (I have a player who joined who happened to have a custom magic amulet... on level 1, so I made it a cursed item that motivates him to do no good).  But my favourite trick is the 4e skill challenge.  I use it for chase scenes and for time-sensitive elements to an adventure."

I also have a list of To-Do's, both as a per-session prep (ex: paint 3x hobgoblins) and an overall thing (ex: research all the locations PCs will visit in Ch4 of HotDQ, etc)- Maps and minis: I spend a lot of time painting minis and building terrain / maps in the 2.5D ""DM Scotty"" method shown on YouTube by The DMG Info and TheDMsCraft. It's therapeutic, plus gives me time for thinking about the game / mentally preparing. - A simple spiral bound notebook.

It's often tempting, because wild luck can sometimes throw a story sideways. Resist. The game needs risk to be fun, including the risk of death.  Fudging rolls makes it difficult to deal with character death. Players feel bad when their characters die, but they can live with it if it is the result of dice rolls. They feel a lot worse if they know that you regularly change numbers behind the screen. That makes the DM, not the dice, responsible for the death of their character.

I then focus what little prep I do on that.  The players have agency, I don't have to worry about where they'll go next - everybody's happy.If I may share a few bonus tricks, I also make a list of things that will happen in the world without the PCs there to stop them, and then say to myself that one or two of them the PCs didn't pursue took place or got closer to taking place.  I make sure each offscreen event is only a single declarative statement, and don't focus on what they mean or where they take place or why they happen - I'm good at improvising those details, and the players invest them with meaning regardless.  Gives the illusion of a living world without me having to do much work.Another thing I do is grab lots of maps and images off the internet and slap them into Roll20 without much thought.  I'll always end up using them, even if I don't get to them that session, and I look prepared even when I'm not (which is most of the time).I never assume anything I prep will get used during the session I prep it for, especially if it's something ""plotty.""  I tie plot points to specific locations and lines of PC inquiry, and always try to make sure they're either evergreen (e.g. ""The tapestry reveals the goblin tribe to have been peaceful until they were betrayed by the humans!"") or only grow in potency as more sessions pass without the truth being discovered.  The reveal that an allied NPC has been spying on the party for the villain all along is shocking in Session 5, but it's DEVASTATING in Session 25.That said, I also try very hard not to commit to any revelation before it comes up in the game.  I view everything in my prep as in flux until it gets used, and I always slot a better idea in if I have one.Finally, I keep my campaign setting skeletal until the players indicate they want me to flesh it out.  The rules already imply a certain kind of setting, so I just assume things work the way they do in the rules until I have an idea or a player says something worth adding to the milieu."

A list of characters and people relevant to my players and their friends/family so I can pull my players deeper into the story by weaving their lives and not just their actions into the story. My computer is a must, as it lets me put on a soundtrack that I can adapt to the situation as it changes, lets me reference my player's backstories, and quickly reference rules and the classes of my players (some are playing homebrew.)","TL;DR lots of rolling with the punches, improv and being creative on the spot. Being intimately knowledgeable with creatures and loot, and everything so I can pull new things and progress the story regardless of what my players throw at me. It's not a single 'trick' but it's my most valuable skill.Improv. Only saying no if what my players want is completely game breaking, or ruins something that's completely crucial. I try not to come up with too much of a plan, rather providing them with situations and occurrences. I make the vast majority of my NPCs, rewards, and other similar details up on the spot. The trick is to keep track of what you've made and how it's affected the party. I do plan out encounters and some areas and treasures, but they're far more important to my world than the players.Example, last night we played our halloween horror session, and I went through each of their backstories this week continually, and came up with ideas for tailored horror dream sequences to each of the players (not written, just things I think would really hurt them inside). However i quickly realized the method I came up with for the reason they were seeing terrifying things wasn't going to work, and i needed something to fix it. So i came up with a cause and source that they later found and tried to heal (it was a small boy possessed by hundreds of tortured souls), but ended up killing. We ended on one player forming a pact with those souls, something I didn't dream of. It's fast and loose, and isn't always perfect, but shooting from the hip like this means I'm able to easily move with my players and prevent railroading them while still moving the story forward through the plot.

The players awoke as zombies in a crypt and had to go and take them back to escape.

All my players are voracious consumers and know every single show, movie, and comic that has come out in the past 20 years. However, I read constantly and love history.

Just add  a sprinkle of magic and fantastic monsters and you've got plenty of fodder for your imagination.  As for that 'sprinkle,'  I use a mix of ideas gleaned from books and magazines collected over the years, such as The Citybooks from Flying Buffalo (old, but still awesome), Jim Pinto's Toolbox and Ultimate Toolbox (I just flip though this when I'm stuck and _every_ _single_ _time_ I find something I can use and adapt), and then just various tables and ephemera I've come up with over the years.As for tools, I use a homemade party tracker sheet to keep up with who is poisoned, charmed, weakened, etc (long-term effects) along with some other notes.  For battles, I use the Pathfinder Combat Pad from Paizo (although we run 5E, it works just fine) to keep up with initiative, status, and any in-encounter short term effects (slowed, hasted, hexed, etc.).  Last but not least, a notebook.  Every game, one of the players will say something that will spark an idea for a future game session, whether it's on off-the-cuff remark, or even a path to solve a problem/riddle I've presented to them that I never even thought was a possible solution.","1) I don't keep up with player HPs/money/encumbrance - I have 6 players right now and don't want to do all that accounting.  I will allow the player to manage all that by themselves.  So if they find a chest of 1000 silver pieces (the pay chest for a small army), they have to tell me how they are going to move all that weight/bulk.  If they can come up with a logical way to do it, then OK.  Game moves on...  If not, oh well... they leave it behind...2) If a player wants to do something that's not 'in the books,' I will ALWAYS allow the possibility.  If it's a skill check that's in the player's core abilities, we will talk it through and I'll allow them to role play a scenario where that idea could come to fruition, and if it's a spur of the moment thing (""I'll climb the wall and attempt to jump on the back of the monster and stab it in the eye""), we'll come up with a couple of ability/percentage roles on possible outcomes (I don't want to rewrite the rule book in the middle of the game), and let them try.  If it's a long term thing (""I want to attract people to this area, and start homesteading it""), we'll work it offline between games over the phone or at lunch during the week.  Eventually, we'll come up with a game mechanic (could just be role play) that will allow the player to attempt to achieve their goal.  Win/win for player and GM!  :)"

Sean McGovern's campaign guides are invaluable: http://thecampaign20xx.blogspot.com/DM's Guild has some great articles too and Roll20 is fantastic!","It's hard for me to brief with this, so I'll just state everything on my mind.1. Always root for the players; the game is not the DM vs. The Players.  It's about creating an enjoyable game for everyone and my fun is proportional to the player's fun.  Allow the players everything in the normal ruleset and tweak them or house rule as little as possible. D&D 5e went through extensive playtesting for a reason.  Work with the players to give them what they want, but sometimes they have to work for it in game or make a compromise.2. Use logic to create interesting situations that will be remembered.  If the PC casts a Thunderwave in a tight underground tunnel, there should be consequences, but don't do it to only screw over the PCs every time.  The NPCs can make mistakes too.  And play to the monster's Intelligence.3. Allow the players to think outside the box and solve situations by not resorting to combat or doing the obvious thing in a situation.  Allow adversaries to give up, attempt to flee, beg for mercy, teleport away, etc.4. You don't need to roll for everything.  Go with the flow and try to streamline the game so that it doesn't get dull.  Pay attention to your players; engage the sleepy or quiet ones; concentrate attacks on the tanks (that's what the player designed their character to do); attack the hard hitting PCs if you can and make them sweat."

When there is so little demanded of players, they are more likely to come back, and that's sort of the foundation of anything interesting in D&D. Developing strongholds, rare+ magic item crafting, unwinding complex narrative threads involving intricate networks, and epic tier combat are all pretty much out of reach if people don't invest the time to get there. And after every session, like clockwork, I ask people verbally, ""Did everybody have fun?"" Players love to affirm their good times, and if there is a problem, it's an opportunity to address it for next game, as opposed to somebody feeling left out or had a bad break with the rules, eventually until they decide the DM doesn't care about them and their contributions and stops coming. Everybody's game is different, and players are all different, but if a DM is focused on providing good humor and a comfortable environment for entertainment, everything else clicks into place quite easily."
